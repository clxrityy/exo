## About Exo

With typical websites that allow for sharable content, every platform has it's own unique way of displaying posts.

For the most part, they are all limited to their static input:
- Image(s)
- Text
- Formatting

The goal of exo is to provide better means for customization and displaying content through tools and/or components the user creates.
